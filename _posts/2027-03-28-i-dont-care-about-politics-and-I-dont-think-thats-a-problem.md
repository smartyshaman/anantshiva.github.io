My friend got mad at me the other day.

She was talking about politics. Passionate, fired up.  
And I said something like,  
> “I don’t really care about politics.”

I could see her reevaluating our entire friendship in real-time.

I wasn’t trying to dismiss her views. I wasn’t mocking her. I just meant what I said.

I don’t care about politics.

And maybe that makes me a bad citizen.  
But it also might be the only thing keeping me sane.

### Socrates had this idea

He didn’t think everyone should vote.  

Not because he thought people were stupid, but because he believed voting was a serious responsibility.  
One that required thought. Reflection. Self-awareness.

You don’t let someone steer a ship without training. Why would you let someone steer a country if they’ve never even thought about what it means to govern?

That idea stuck with me. Especially now, when so much of politics feels like it’s about taking sides instead of asking questions.

It wasn’t about intelligence.  
It was about **wisdom**.  
About emotional maturity. About asking good questions instead of yelling bad answers.

### Which brings me to Singapore.

I vote for the PAP in every election.

Not because they’re flawless.  
Not because I think they’ve gotten everything right.  
But because I believe they’ve done a lot well - and more importantly, they think long-term.

Their plans for Singapore are rarely reactive. They're deliberate. Structured. Future-focused.

Do I agree with everything? Nope.  
There are real issues — cost of living, inequality, housing pressures.  
But I also look around at the chaos in other countries and think: actually, we’re doing okay. More than okay, really.

The systems here work.  
Public housing. Public transport. Healthcare. Education. Safety.

These aren’t small things. 

It’s not perfect, sure, and there are things I wish were different. But overall?  
It gives people like me the space to live, raise a child, and focus on things that matter personally.

### This is why I don’t get caught up in political tribalism
 
iPhone vs Android.
Man Utd vs Liverpool.
Islam vs Christianity.
PAP vs WP. 

Everything is a fucking rivalry.  
And once you pick a side, you’re not allowed to acknowledge anything good about the other.

I find that exhausting. And unnecessary.

Singapore is small. We can’t afford to fracture ourselves over slogans and vibes.

### What I care about more is: what can I control?

I’ve never been drawn to political identity.

I’m more interested in what a system allows people to do.

I care about raising my kid well.  
I care about learning new things.  
I care about staying healthy, being a good teacher, showing up for people I love.

I’m not blindly loyal to any party. But I believe in results. I believe in structure.  
And I believe in giving credit where it’s due — even if it’s not the trendy thing to say.

If something feels wrong, I’ll say it.  
If something feels broken, I’ll speak up about it.

But I won’t let politics consume me.

### Maybe that’s cowardice.  
Or maybe it’s clarity.

I believe in personal agency.  
I believe in fixing yourself before trying to fix the system.  
I believe you can be engaged without being enraged.  
I believe it’s possible to live well without having to shout about it.

So yeah, I don’t care about politics the way some people do.  

And if that makes me a bad citizen...  
Well, Socrates got sentenced to death too. So I guess I’m in good company.
