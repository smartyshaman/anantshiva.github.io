*Note: This isn’t a political post. It’s not an argument. It’s not meant to convince anyone of anything. It’s just me thinking out loud about something I’ve been reflecting on lately.*

A few weeks ago, I was chatting with a friend. She’s passionate about Singapore politics, especially the opposition. She volunteers at rallies, stays updated on debates, and believes the ruling party has had it too easy for too long.

Somewhere in the conversation, I said, "I don’t really care that much about politics."

It wasn’t meant as a provocation. It was just me being honest.

The conversation turned awkward after that. I could feel her pulling back, like I had said something careless or shallow. But the truth is - I’ve been thinking about why I said it, and I still stand by it.

Not because I don’t care about society or how decisions get made. But because I care more about other things.

I’ve always liked the way Socrates thought about civic responsibility. He believed that making decisions about governance isn’t just a right - it’s something that requires thought, reflection, and discipline. He compared it to steering a ship. You wouldn’t hand the wheel to someone who’s never learned how to navigate.

That metaphor makes sense to me, especially when I look at how people talk about politics today. It often feels less like steering a ship and more like shouting at each other over who gets to sit at the wheel.

When it comes to Singapore, my view is simple: this country works. It’s not perfect, but the foundations are solid. The public housing system works. Healthcare is accessible. Education is fair, even if you’re not rich. The trains show up on time. There’s a basic structure here that supports people who want to build something meaningful with their lives.

That’s not something I take lightly.

And because of that, I vote for the PAP in every election.

Not because I think they’re flawless. Not because I agree with everything they do. But because, on balance, they’ve demonstrated something I care deeply about: long-term thinking. They don’t just govern for the next election cycle. They build for the next ten, twenty, thirty years.

I don’t see that kind of forward thinking in many other places.

Of course, there are issues. Housing costs, inequality, rising expenses—it’s not all sunshine. But when I compare what’s happening here to the mess I see elsewhere, it’s clear to me that Singapore is doing more than most.

That’s why I don’t get worked up about politics. I don’t see the point of turning it into a team sport, like Liverpool vs Man Utd or iPhone vs Android. Too many people spend their energy arguing about which side is better, without realizing they’re caught in the same game.

What I care about more is whether the system allows me - and people like me - to live well. To raise my kid. To do meaningful work. To focus on the things I can control.

That’s where I choose to spend my energy.

I care about whether my son can get a good education.  
Whether I can walk home safely at night.  
Whether I can teach my students something useful.  
Whether I can keep learning, keep improving, keep showing up.

That’s what matters to me.

If something feels unfair, I’ll question it. If something breaks, I’ll say something. But I don’t want politics to become part of my identity. I don’t want to live my life in a permanent argument.

There are better things to do with my time.

That’s where I’m at right now. Maybe that’ll change. But for now, I’d rather focus on what I can actually control.
