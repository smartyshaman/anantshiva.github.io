That’s what matters to me.

If something feels unfair, I’ll question it. If something breaks, I’ll say something. But I don’t want politics to become part of my identity. I don’t want to live my life in a permanent argument.

There are better things to do with my time.

That’s where I’m at right now. Maybe that’ll change. But for now, I’d rather focus on what I can actually control.
